# Decentralized Energy Demand Response System

A blockchain-based demand response platform that enables utilities and energy consumers to participate in decentralized grid management through smart contracts. The system automates load forecasting, demand reduction requests, and incentive distribution while maintaining transparency and trust between all participants.

## System Overview

The Decentralized Energy Demand Response System consists of five interconnected smart contracts that work together to create an automated, transparent, and efficient demand response ecosystem:

- **Utility Verification Contract**: Validates and manages energy provider credentials
- **Consumer Registration Contract**: Handles consumer onboarding and profile management
- **Load Forecasting Contract**: Predicts peak demand periods using historical data
- **Reduction Request Contract**: Manages demand reduction campaigns and participation
- **Incentive Distribution Contract**: Automates reward calculations and payments

## Smart Contract Architecture

### 1. Utility Verification Contract
**Purpose**: Establishes trust by validating legitimate energy providers

**Key Functions**:
- Verify utility company credentials and regulatory compliance
- Maintain a registry of approved energy providers
- Handle utility profile updates and status changes
- Enforce minimum requirements for participation

**Features**:
- Multi-signature verification process
- Regulatory compliance checking
- Reputation scoring system
- Automated renewal processes

### 2. Consumer Registration Contract
**Purpose**: Manages consumer onboarding and maintains participant profiles

**Key Functions**:
- Register new energy consumers with KYC verification
- Store consumer energy usage patterns and preferences
- Manage participation consent and privacy settings
- Track consumer reliability scores

**Features**:
- Privacy-preserving data storage
- Flexible participation preferences
- Historical performance tracking
- Automated eligibility verification

### 3. Load Forecasting Contract
**Purpose**: Predicts peak demand periods to optimize grid management

**Key Functions**:
- Analyze historical consumption data
- Generate demand forecasts using machine learning algorithms
- Identify potential grid stress periods
- Trigger preemptive demand response events

**Features**:
- Real-time data integration
- Weather and seasonal adjustments
- Accuracy tracking and model improvement
- Emergency load prediction capabilities

### 4. Reduction Request Contract
**Purpose**: Coordinates demand reduction campaigns and tracks participation

**Key Functions**:
- Issue demand reduction requests to registered consumers
- Define reduction targets and time windows
- Track real-time participation and compliance
- Validate actual energy reduction achievements

**Features**:
- Tiered reduction request system
- Real-time monitoring and alerts
- Flexible participation options
- Performance verification mechanisms

### 5. Incentive Distribution Contract
**Purpose**: Automates reward calculations and payment distribution

**Key Functions**:
- Calculate incentive payments based on participation
- Distribute rewards to qualifying consumers
- Handle bonus payments for exceptional performance
- Manage payment schedules and methods

**Features**:
- Dynamic pricing algorithms
- Multi-token support (utility tokens, stablecoins)
- Automated payment processing
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

## System Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
1. **Utility Verification**: Energy providers undergo verification process
2. **Consumer Registration**: End users register and provide necessary information
3. **Profile Configuration**: Both utilities and consumers set preferences and parameters

### 2. Forecasting and Planning
1. **Data Collection**: System gathers historical usage data and external factors
2. **Demand Prediction**: Load forecasting contract generates demand predictions
3. **Event Planning**: System identifies periods requiring demand response

### 3. Demand Response Execution
1. **Request Generation**: Reduction request contract issues demand reduction calls
2. **Consumer Notification**: Registered consumers receive reduction requests
3. **Participation Tracking**: System monitors real-time energy consumption changes
4. **Verification**: Actual reductions are verified against baselines

### 4. Incentive Processing
1. **Performance Calculation**: System calculates individual and aggregate performance
2. **Reward Computation**: Incentive amounts are calculated based on participation
3. **Payment Distribution**: Rewards are automatically distributed to participants
4. **Record Keeping**: All transactions and performance data are recorded
